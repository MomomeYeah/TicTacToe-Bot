## How to Build
Install [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) and add the Gradle bin directory to your path.  Navigate to your local project directory and use the following commands:

`gradle eclipse` to install all the necessary files to develop this project in Eclipse

`gradle installDist` to download and install all dependencies, and run TicTacToe-Bot automatically

## HTTPS Certificates
Depending on the CA used by your Merknera server, and the version of Java you are using, you may need to import your server's HTTPS certificate into your keystore.

To do this, first find your $JAVA_HOME directory.  If this is not set on your system, you can print it from Java by running the following:

`System.out.println(System.getProperty("java.home"));`

Navigate to $JAVA_HOME/lib/security, where there should be a file called `cacerts`

To view the contents of your certificate store, run the following command:

`keytool -list -keystore cacerts`

If prompted for a password, the default value is `changeit`

Navigate to your Merknera server, and download the HTTPS certificate from your browser.

Add it to your keystore with the following command:

`sudo keytool -import -noprompt -trustcacerts -alias <alias> -file <path to certificate you just downloaded> -keystore cacerts -storepass <password to cacerts>`

You will be prompted for your sudo password; enter this.

Java should now be able to connect to Merknera via HTTPS!
